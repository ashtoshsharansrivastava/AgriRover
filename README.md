# AgriRover
The Agri-Rover is a simulated farming robot that autonomously monitors soil conditions. Built in Tinkercad, its key feature is a servo-operated arm that dips a sensor into the ground for precise moisture analysis. It also reads temperature and light, displaying all data on an onboard LCD screen.
